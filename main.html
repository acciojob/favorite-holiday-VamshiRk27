	<h1>Hyderabad</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The name Hyderabad means "Haydar's city" or "lion city",
		 from haydar 'lion' and abad 'city', 
		after Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, 
		also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battle.
		The city was originally called Baghnagar ("city of gardens"), 
		and later acquired the name Hyderabad. 
		The European travelers von Poser and 
		Thevenot found both names in use in the 17th century.
